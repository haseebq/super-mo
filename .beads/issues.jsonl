Implement a POST endpoint at functions/api/chat.ts that proxies requests to OpenRouter’s https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions endpoint. The function must read OPENROUTER_API_KEY from Cloudflare environment variables and must never expose it to the client. The endpoint is not a general-purpose chat API: it is a game-specific AI endpoint. Define and own the system prompt inside chat.ts, and do not accept system prompts from the client. The server must prepend its own fixed system prompt to every request and strip or ignore any client-supplied system messages. The client may only send user messages representing player input and serialized game state.\n\nTool calling must be supported for game state changes, but tool schemas must be defined and controlled server-side; the endpoint must not accept arbitrary tool definitions from the client. The function must forward assistant responses and tool calls verbatim back to the SPA, but must not execute tools or manage game state. The SPA is responsible for interpreting tool calls and applying state changes.\n\nAdd basic abuse protections in the function, including per-IP rate limiting, request size limits, a maximum token cap, and a model allowlist. Update the SPA to call /api/chat instead of calling OpenRouter directly.\n\nAdd CI/CD that automatically deploys to Cloudflare Pages on pushes to the main branch. Use Wrangler in CI to deploy the Pages project. Secrets (CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID, and OPENROUTER_API_KEY) must be provided via CI environment variables and must never be committed to the repository. The CI workflow should install dependencies, build the SPA if a build step exists, and run wrangler pages deploy (or equivalent) to publish the site and functions to Cloudflare Pages. Optionally support local development using wrangler pages dev.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-31T16:20:36.059693-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-02T11:10:37.642705-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-02T11:10:37.642705-05:00","close_reason":"Completed"}
