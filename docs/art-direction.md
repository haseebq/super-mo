# Super Mo - Art Direction

## Theme
Bright, playful, and slightly whimsical. Inspired by classic 16-bit platformers but with a clean, modern read. Shapes are bold, outlines are subtle, and colors are cheerful without being neon.

## Visual Style
- **Pixel art** with clean silhouettes
- **Consistent light source** (top-left)
- **Soft shading** (1-2 shades per color)
- **Minimal outlines** only where needed for readability
