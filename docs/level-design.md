# Super Mo - Level Design Pillars

## Pillars
1. **Teach, then test**: Introduce a mechanic safely, then raise stakes.
2. **Always moving**: Encourage forward momentum with flowing layouts.
3. **Optional reward**: Side paths with coins/rare items.
4. **Fair challenge**: Clear telegraphs and safe recovery windows.

## Level 1 Outline (World 1-1)
### Segment A - Intro (0:00-0:30)
- Flat ground, a few coins, low-risk jumps.
- First enemy in a wide lane (stomp teaches mechanic).

### Segment B - Vertical Variation (0:30-1:00)
- Small platforms, gentle gaps.
- First hidden block with coin reward.

### Segment C - Momentum (1:00-1:40)
- Slight slopes or stepping stones.
- Two enemies spaced for timing practice.

### Segment D - Optional Route (1:40-2:10)
- High path with extra coins + rare collectible.
- Safe drop back to main route.

### Segment E - Finish (2:10-2:40)
- Final jump sequence into goal flag.
- Visual cue for level end.

## Checkpoints
- One midpoint checkpoint after Segment C.

## Difficulty Targets
- Completion time: 2-3 minutes.
