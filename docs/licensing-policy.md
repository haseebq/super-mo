# Licensing Policy

We only use permissively licensed code, tools, and assets:
- Allowed: MIT, BSD, CC0, OFL (and similarly permissive).
- Not allowed: copyleft/NC/SA/restricted terms.

Practices:
- Record license + attribution for every external asset/dependency.
- Prefer repos and packs that ship clear LICENSE files.
- Block additions that lack permissive terms until replaced.
